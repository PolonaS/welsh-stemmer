# Python: Getting Started

A barebones Django app.


## Running Locally

Make sure you have Python 3.7 [installed locally](http://install.python-guide.org).

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py runserver 5000
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
